## fyacp
 A sucessor to [yacp](https://github.com/CredibleOpossum/yacp) which is useful because it uses a letterbox system which is too slow for making a meaningfully powerful chess engine. This one instead uses [bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards).

> [!Warning]
>
> Not completely implemented, will never be as fast as large engine's move generation such as [stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish).

Required rules to be implemented:
* Castling
* Promotion
* En Passant
* Tests

Future implementation:
* [Perft](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft)
* [Minimax evaluation algorithm](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Minimax)
* [Magic bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards)
